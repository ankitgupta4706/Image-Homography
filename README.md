# Image-Homography

Image Homography is a fundamental concept in computer vision and image processing that refers to the geometric transformation of a 2D image onto another 2D image plane. This transformation is particularly useful for image registration, object tracking, image stitching, and perspective correction.

Homography is a mathematical transformation that relates the corresponding points between two images captured from different viewpoints or with different camera orientations. It allows the transformation of image features, such as points, lines, or planes, from one image to another, preserving their geometric relationships.
